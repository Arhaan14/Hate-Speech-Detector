# Hate-Speech-Detector
Hate Speech Detection is a machine learning project aimed at identifying and classifying hate speech in text data. This repository contains code written in Python using Jupyter Notebook for hate speech detection, data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess text data for hate speech analysis.
Feature Extraction: Extract features from text data using techniques like TF-IDF, word embeddings, etc.
Machine Learning Models: Train and evaluate machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, SVM, or LSTM for hate speech detection.
Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
Graphical Analysis: Visualize model performance, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and other relevant insights using graphs and plots.

# Setup
1. Clone the Repository
2. Install Dependencies
3. Open Jupyter Notebook
4. Run the project
